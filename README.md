# Online Streaming Analysis

## Installation
This code is written in a Jupyter notebook and is coded in Python 3. I have used Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, os, BeautifulSoup, time and re (for regex) to complete the project. Hence, these need to be installed.

## Project Motivation
The online streaming domain has been heating up with the entry of Disney+, Apple, HBO Max. However, Netflix remains the biggest player in the market with Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ trailing slightly behind it.

In this project I have compared the content between Amazon, Dinsey+, HBO Max and Netflix to gather insights into this online streaming war. The main questions that I am interested in are-
1) Which streaming platform has the latest content?
2) Does a particular streaming platform have more high quality content (IMDB rating) comapred to others?
3) Does a particular streaming platform have more fresh tomato content (Rotten Tomato rating) comapred to others?
4) How does the amount of content in different streaming platform vary for different age groups?
5) Which platform has the highest rated IMDB shows available online?
6) How much original contents are Netflix and Amazon creating?
7) In which genres is Netflix creating more original content?
8) Which genres are the most popular among Netflix and Amazon?

## File Description
There is a Jupyter notebook in .ipynb format. I have also written a blogpost on Medium summarizing all the insights that I gathered.
